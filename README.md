# 🚀 OpenKernel

> A modern, modular, and learning-oriented operating system kernel project.

---

## 📌 About The Project

**OpenKernel** is a kernel development project designed to improve low-level system programming skills and to understand modern operating system architecture.

This project aims to:

* Interact directly with hardware
* Develop kernel-level services
* Build a minimal and understandable architecture

---

## 🎯 Goals

* 🧠 Simple and learnable kernel architecture
* ⚙️ Development of core kernel services
* 🖥️ Low-level hardware control (CPU, memory, I/O)
* 📦 Modular structure (expandable and maintainable)
* 🔒 Secure and controlled system behavior

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C / x86 Assembly
* **Compiler:** GCC (i686-elf)
* **Assembler:** NASM
* **Emulator:** QEMU / VMware
